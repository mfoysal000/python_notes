#Lesson 3 Integers and floats
# Arithmetic Operators:
# Addition:       3 + 2
# Subtraction:    3 - 2
# Multiplication: 3 * 2
# Division:       3 / 2
# Floor Division: 3 // 2 removes remainder so 3/2 = 1.5 while 3//2 = 1
# Exponent:       3 ** 2
# Modulus:        3 % 2 gives remainder


# Comparisons:
# Equal:            3 == 2
# Not Equal:        3 != 2
# Greater Than:     3 > 2
# Less Than:        3 < 2
# Greater or Equal: 3 >= 2
# Less or Equal:    3 <= 2

modulus is used to test for odd/even numbers
1 = odd 0 = even
example 2%2 = 0 while 3%2 = 1
-------
abs is absolute value so
print(abs(-x)) will print x
----------
print(round(3.75)) ...rounds the value
if you do round(3.75, 1)...rounds to 1st decimal place up
----------

num += 1 ...increments whatever num was with +1
i.e. If num =1 then new num is 2

------
#Comparisons
used for boolean comparisons like comparing numbers

num_1=3
num_2=2

print(num_1 == num_2)
op: False b/c they aren't equal
!= is true though b/c they aren't equal


#to convert class to different one
num_1 = '100' obv a string

num_1 = int(num_1)

now it will become a int
